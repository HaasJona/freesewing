title: "Umbra undies: Fabric Options"

You need a fabric with plenty of horizontal and vertical stretch (sometimes called “four-way stretch”) for this pattern. Preferably something that is comfortable, soft, and breathable.

Recommended fabrics include stretch jerseys, stretch mesh, stretch knits, or most fabrics with at least 5% spandex. For example, modal (rayon) jersey with spandex.

To test the stretch of your fabric, hold a known length of fabric against a rule. 
Then measure the length you can stretch that length of fabric to. 
For example if you can stretch a length of fabric from 10 cm to 18 cm, that fabric has a max stretch of 80%. If you can only stretch it to 13 cm, the stretch factor would be 30%.
Measure the stretch in both directions (horizontal and vertical).

Good underwear fabric should have a max stretch of around 60-80%. If your fabric has a stretch of only around 30%, it's probably pure cotton and less suitable for underwear.

Adjust the "horizontal fabric stretch" and "vertical fabric stretch" options according to your fabric. Do **not** enter the max fabric stretch.

If you have fabric with around 80% stretch, a good default value for the horizontal stretch is 30%. This is what most commercial underwear I tested uses.
If your fabric has only around 30% stretch, choose 15% horizontal stretch max. 
If you want to use zipper pockets, go with a low stretch as the zippers can't stretch.
A fabric will wear out fast if you wear it near its maximum stretch, it will also be very uncomfortable. I recommend that the entered values should stay below half of the max stretch.

The vertical stretch can be much lower. If you use a fabric that stretches more in one direction, use that for the horizontal direction.
A good general value for the vertical stretch is around 5%. If it is too high, the fabric may press uncomfortably against your crotch area. 

<Note>
* If you use a different fabric for the lining, make sure it has around the same stretch as the outer fabric.
* If you use the same fabric for the lining, make sure to mark the lining piece, as otherwise both pieces may get confused easily during sewing.
