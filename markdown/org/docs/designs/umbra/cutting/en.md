title: "Umbra undies: Cutting Instructions"
---

Umbra consists of a back piece and a lined front piece.
This is the cut list:

- **Main fabric**
  - Cut **1 front**
  - Cut **1 back**
- **Lining fabric**
  - Cut **1 front**

If you use a serger, you can cut away excess fabric with the knife, so use standard seam allowance.

If you don't have a serger, I recommend using a seam allowance of 5 mm with an overlook foot and a flexible overedge / fake overlock stitch.

Depending on how you want to finish the leg seams, it's usually a good idea to skip the seam allowance on the legs of the lining part as you will be folding over the front fabric to the inside.
if you want to use fold over elastics for the leg, skip the seam allowance for the leg opening on all parts.

##### Notes

- Umbra is a great scrap buster. If you have fabric scraps from making a [Teagan t-shirt](/designs/teagan/) or anything from a jersey fabric that has good stretch, this is a good way to use those up. If you only have smaller pieces, instead of cutting the pieces on the fold, you can cut both halves separately and sew them together. However, this introduces additional seams.
- You can use the same fabric for the whole garment, including the front lining. Some people prefer using softer fabrics or different materials for the lining.
