The balance between these two ways to increase (or decrease) the cross seam is the `crossSeamFitBalance` option which defaults to `0.5`. Once the cross seam is the correct length, we also make sure we respect the horizontal distance from cross seam to side by shifting the side seam outwards. |

So I just used a straight line as that makes handling the dart so so much easier. On that note, we've already constructed the dart at this point. Now we don't only have to move it, but it's also no longer on a horizontal line, so we have to slightly rotate it. AS such, I'm going to move the construction of the dart further down the code so that we construct it in the right place rather than moving it afterwards. |
